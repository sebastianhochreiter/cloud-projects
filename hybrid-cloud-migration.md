# Hybrid Cloud Data Migration

## Detailed Project Description
This project aimed to migrate a portion of an enterprise's data from on-premises storage to a public cloud, while keeping sensitive data within a private cloud for security reasons.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Balancing the need for scalable, cost-effective storage with strict security and compliance requirements.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The challenge was to securely migrate non-sensitive data to a public cloud and keep sensitive data in a private cloud, ensuring seamless integration between the two.
- Requirements included secure data transfer, hybrid cloud setup, and latency optimization.

### 3. The Process
- Utilized AWS for the public cloud and VMware for the private cloud.
- Employed AWS Direct Connect for secure and low-latency data transfer between the on-premises data center and AWS.
- Set up a hybrid cloud environment using AWS Outposts.
- Technologies used included AWS, VMware, and AWS Direct Connect.

### 4. The Results
- Successfully migrated data with zero loss and minimal downtime.
- Achieved cost savings of approximately 20% by leveraging public cloud storage for non-sensitive data.
