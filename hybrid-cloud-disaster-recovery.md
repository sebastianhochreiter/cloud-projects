# Hybrid Cloud Disaster Recovery

## Detailed Project Description
This project involved setting up a disaster recovery solution using a hybrid cloud architecture to ensure high availability and data integrity.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Ensuring high availability and data integrity in the event of hardware failure, data corruption, or other catastrophic events.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- Creating a disaster recovery plan that employs both public and private clouds, with automated failover and backup mechanisms.
- Requirements included replication, monitoring, and automated failover.

### 3. The Process
- Utilized Microsoft Azure for the public cloud and OpenStack for the private cloud.
- Configured Azure Site Recovery for automated failover to the public cloud.
- Employed OpenStack's built-in backup solutions for the private cloud.
- Technologies used included Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, and Azure Site Recovery.

### 4. The Results
- Achieved a robust disaster recovery solution with high availability.
- Reduced recovery time objectives (RTO) by an estimated 40%, minimizing business impact during downtime.
