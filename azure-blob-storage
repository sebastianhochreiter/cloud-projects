# Azure Blob Storage for Media Files

## Detailed Project Description
This project aimed to migrate an existing media library from on-premises storage to Azure Blob Storage, thereby benefiting from cloud scalability and reliability.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Storing large media files on-premises can be both costly and challenging to scale. A cloud-based storage solution can offer more flexibility and security.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The challenge was to securely migrate existing media files from on-premises storage to Azure Blob Storage.
- Requirements included data migration, setting up access controls, and ensuring data integrity.

### 3. The Process
- Utilized Azure Storage Account to set up a Blob container for storing media files.
- Migrated existing media files using Azure Storage Explorer.
- Configured access policies and enabled Azure CDN for faster media delivery.
- Technologies used included Azure Blob Storage, Azure Storage Explorer, and Azure CDN.

### 4. The Results
- Successfully migrated all media files to Azure Blob Storage with zero data loss.
- Improved media access speed by an estimated 25% through Azure CDN integration.
