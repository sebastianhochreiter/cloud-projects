# Cloud-Based Machine Learning Pipeline

## Detailed Project Description
The project focused on creating an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predictive maintenance of manufacturing equipment.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Minimizing equipment downtime is critical for manufacturing efficiency. An ML-based predictive maintenance system can forecast failures and schedule timely maintenance.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- Develop a scalable, reliable machine learning pipeline that can process real-time data and predict equipment failures.
- Requirements included data ingestion, data transformation, model training, and real-time prediction.

### 3. The Process
- Selected Azure as the cloud platform, utilizing services like Azure Databricks for data processing and Azure ML for model training and deployment.
- Created data ingestion pipelines using Azure Event Hub.
- Employed Azure Databricks for data transformation and feature engineering.
- Used Azure ML to train a predictive model and deployed it as a web service.
- Technologies used included Azure Databricks, Azure ML, Azure Event Hub, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### 4. The Results
- Reduced unscheduled equipment downtime by 20%.
- Improved the efficiency of the maintenance process, resulting in a 15% cost saving on maintenance.
