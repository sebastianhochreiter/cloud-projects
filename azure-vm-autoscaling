# Azure Virtual Machine Auto-Scaling

## Detailed Project Description
The Azure Virtual Machine Auto-Scaling project focused on implementing an automated scaling solution for Azure VMs to handle variable workloads, thereby optimizing resource usage and costs.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Handling variable workloads efficiently is a challenge for many businesses. Auto-scaling offers a way to optimize resource usage and thereby reduce costs.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The project involved setting up an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set to automatically adjust the number of VM instances.
- Requirements included defining scaling conditions, configuring alerts, and testing the auto-scaling functionality.

### 3. The Process
- Utilized Azure Portal to create a Virtual Machine Scale Set.
- Configured scaling policies based on CPU usage thresholds.
- Tested the scaling functionality by simulating varying workloads.
- Technologies used included Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Azure Monitor.

### 4. The Results
- Achieved a more elastic and cost-effective infrastructure.
- Reduced operational costs by approximately 20% due to optimized resource allocation.
