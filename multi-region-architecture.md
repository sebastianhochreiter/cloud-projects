# Multi-Region High Availability Architecture

## Detailed Project Description
This project aimed to design and implement a multi-region high availability (HA) architecture for a mission-critical web application.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Ensuring 99.99% uptime for a web application that has global users, making it vital to eliminate single points of failure and minimize latency.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- Design and implement a multi-region HA architecture.
- Requirements included load balancing, data replication, and automatic failover mechanisms.

### 3. The Process
- Conducted a risk assessment to identify single points of failure in the existing system.
- Chose AWS as the cloud provider, utilizing services like EC2, RDS, S3, and Route 53.
- Implemented a multi-region load balancer using AWS ELB.
- Set up cross-region data replication for the RDS database.
- Technologies used included AWS EC2, RDS, S3, ELB, and Route 53.

### 4. The Results
- Achieved a 99.99% uptime since implementation.
- Reduced the average latency by 30% for users in different geographic locations.
